## ðŸ“Š Key KPIs I Implemented

Here are the KPIs/metrics I worked on for the **first dashboard**:

1. **Maintenance Type Distribution (CM vs PM)**  
   - Shows proportion of corrective vs. preventive maintenance.  
   - Formula:  
     ```
     (Bookings by Maintenance Type / Total Bookings) * 100
     ```

2. **Recurring Issues Rate**  
   - Identifies % of repeated issues for the same vehicle within 30 days.  
   - Formula:  
     ```
     (Repeated Service Codes per Vehicle / Total Service Codes) * 100
     ```

3. **First-Time Fix Rate**  
   - Measures how often an issue is resolved on the first attempt.  
   - Formula:  
     ```
     (Unique Service Entries without Repeat / Total Service Entries) * 100
     ```

4. **Maintenance Backlog Volume**  
   - Tracks number of pending or unfinished requests.  
   - Formula:  
     ```
     Count of requests with Status = 'Pending' or 'Finished'
     ```

5. **Top Service Bundles**  
   - Identifies the most common sets of services performed together.  
   - Formula:  
     ```
     Group services by BookingID â†’ Count frequency â†’ Top N bundles
     ```

6. **Capacity Utilization Rate**  
   - Measures how much of the service center capacity is used.  
   - Formula:  
     ```
     (Actual Bookings / Total Capacity) * 100
     ```

7. **Top 5 Requested Services**  
   - Shows the most frequently booked services.  
   - Formula:  
     ```
     Count of ServiceCode across bookings â†’ Top 5
     ```
